# Pyrogram Playbot

A good template for Pyrogram based bot projects (with asynchronous HTTP server and plugins support)

> DISCLAIMER : The core structure of this template was taken from [eyaadh](https://github.com/eyaadh)s [Megatron](https://github.com/eyaadh/megadlbot_oss) project. This is just a simple template that **I THINK** will help amateurs like me to quickstart a Pyrogram based asynchronous bot development.

## Features

- [Asychronous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchrony_(computer_programming))
- [Pyrogram](https://github.com/pyrogram/pyrogram) based Telegram bot
- [AIOHTTP](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp) based HTTP server
- Plugins support (Using Pyrograms [Smart Plugins System](https://docs.pyrogram.org/topics/smart-plugins))
